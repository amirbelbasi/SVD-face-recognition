# face-recognition-SVD

* Face Recognition using SVD | Applied Linear Algebra
  * Trained a face recognition model using singular value decomposition (SVD)
  * Utilized Python, normalization of image using the mean image, NumPy for matrix calculations, and the given face dataset & testset for training & evaluation
